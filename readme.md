# DPI-Scripts
These scripts were originally inspired by the _Plankline_ project controlled by OSU [original OSU version](https://zenodo.org/record/4641158)(DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4641158)[[1]](#1). I have completely rewritten the codebase in modern Python/Tensorflow to suit our architecture and to improve logging and performance. __DPI-Scripts__ are available as is and without guarantee. These are intended for in-house use at UAF and at other research outlets. Scripts here have been written by Thomas Kelly, but will likely share some code with others (e.g., Github, Stackoverflow, etc)--but I have attempted to notate original author/inspiration where possible.


## Setup and Documentation

The DPI-Scripts suite of processing scripts is split into three main modules: (1) segmentation, (2) classification, and (3) training; and is unified with the scripts in this repository. 

If you are new to linux and setting up a DPI-Scripts instance for the first time, please consider skimming the [Linux Help Guide](docs/Linux-Help-Guide.md). Otherwise, please follow below for the quick setup guide.

## Overview


## 1. Hardware Requirements
__Data Storage__
- Min: 8 TB
- Recommend SSD and/or RAID0 for high-throughput access.

__System Memory__
- Min: 16GB
- Recommend 32GB (or more)

__Networking__
Recommend 10Gbe for raw data transfer.

__Nvidia GPU (recommended)__
- CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 8GB ram
-- RTX 30 series or later (recommended)
-- RTX 3060 12GB (tested)
-- RTX 4060 8GB (tested)

## 2. Software Requirements

__Operating System (tested)__
- Windows 10 (or later)
-- (required for CUDA support, optional) Windows Subsystem for Linux 
- Linux Ubuntu 2204 (or later)
- MacOS 14 (or later)

__Python__
- Python 3.9 - 3.11
- Tensorflow 2.16
- pillow 10.3
- opencv-python 4.9

__CUDA Support (recommended)__
- Nvidia Driver 535 (or later) 
- CUDA 12.2
- cuda-nvcc 12.2


## 3. Quick Start & Usage

To run plankline with a specific configuration file and input directory:

    python3 segmentation.py <path/to/raw/folder>
    python3 classification.py <path/to/segmented/folder>
    
    python3 train.py


So for example:

    python3 segmentation.py /data/raw/camera0/test1
    python3 classification.py /data/analysis/camera0/test1-REG

    python3 train.py
